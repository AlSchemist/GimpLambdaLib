; 		A special form and-let*
;	           Validation code
;
; AND-LET* (formerly known as LAND*) is an AND with local bindings,
; a guarded LET* special form.
; It evaluates a sequence of forms one after another till the first one 
; that yields #f; the non-#f result of a form can be bound to a fresh variable and
; used in the subsequent forms.
;
; It is defined in SRFI-2 <http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-2/>
;
; Motivation:
; When an ordinary AND is formed of _proper_ boolean expressions: (AND E1 E2 ...)
;
; the expression E2, if it gets to be evaluated, knows that E1 has returned non-#f.
; Moreover, E2 knows exactly what the result of E1 was - #t 
; - so E2 can use this knowledge to its advantage.
; If E1 however is an _extended_ boolean expression, E2 can no longer tell
; which particular non-#f value was returned by E1. 
; Chances are it took a lot of work to evaluate E1, and the produced result
; (a number, a vector, a string, etc) may be of value to E2.
; Alas, the AND form merely checks that the result is not an #f, and throws it away.
; If E2 needs it, it has to recompute the value again.
; This proposed AND-LET* special form lets constituent expressions get hold
; of the results of already evaluated expressions, without re-doing their work.
;
; Syntax: (AND-LET* (CLAWS) BODY)
;
; where CLAWS is a list of expressions or bindings: CLAWS ::= '() | (cons CLAW CLAWS)
; Every element of the CLAWS list, a CLAW, must be one of the following:
;	(VARIABLE EXPRESSION) or (EXPRESSION) or BOUND-VARIABLE
; These CLAWS are evaluated in the strict left-to-right order.
; For each CLAW, the EXPRESSION part is evaluated first (or BOUND-VARIABLE is looked up).
;
; If the result is #f, AND-LET* immediately returns #f,
; thus disregarding the rest of the CLAWS and the BODY.
; If the EXPRESSION evaluates to not-#f, and the CLAW is of the form
;	(VARIABLE EXPRESSION)
; the EXPRESSION's value is bound to a freshly made VARIABLE.
; => The VARIABLE is available for _the rest_ of the CLAWS, and the BODY.
;
; Thus AND-LET* is a sort of cross-breed between LET* and AND.
;
; Denotation semantics:
;
; Eval[ (AND-LET* (CLAW1 ...) BODY), Env] =
;	EvalClaw[ CLAW1, Env ] andalso 
;		Eval[ (AND-LET* ( ...) BODY), ExtClawEnv[ CLAW1, Env]]
;
; Eval[ (AND-LET* (CLAW) ), Env] = EvalClaw[ CLAW, Env ]
; Eval[ (AND-LET* () FORM1 ...), Env] = Eval[ (BEGIN FORM1 ...), Env ]
; Eval[ (AND-LET* () ), Env] = #t
;
; EvalClaw[ BOUND-VARIABLE, Env ] = Eval[ BOUND-VARIABLE, Env ]
; EvalClaw[ (EXPRESSION), Env ] = Eval[ EXPRESSION, Env ]
; EvalClaw[ (VARIABLE EXPRESSION), Env ] = Eval[ EXPRESSION, Env ]
;
; ExtClawEnv[ BOUND-VARIABLE, Env ] = Env
; ExtClawEnv[ (EXPRESSION), Env ] = EnvAfterEval[ EXPRESSION, Env ]
; ExtClawEnv[ (VARIABLE EXPRESSION), Env ] = 
;	ExtendEnv[ EnvAfterEval[ EXPRESSION, Env ],
;		   VARIABLE boundto Eval[ EXPRESSION, Env ]]
;
; If AND-LET* is implemented as a macro, it converts a AND-LET* expression
; into a "tree" of AND and LET expressions. For example,
#|
(AND-LET* ((my-list (compute-list)) ((not (null? my-list))))
  	(do-something my-list)
)
 |#;->	is transformed into
#| AlSchemist: the interest of the first and is negotiable
(and	(let	(	(my-list (compute-list)))
			(and	my-list
					(not (null? my-list))
					(begin (do-something my-list))
)		)	)
 |#

; Sample applications:
#| The following piece of code (from my treap package)  
(let	((new-root (node:dispatch-on-key root key ...)))
	(if new-root (set! root new-root))
)
 |# ;-> could be elegantly re-written as
#|
(and-let* ((new-root (node:dispatch-on-key root key ...)))
	(set! root new-root)
)
 |#

; A very common application of and-let* is looking up a value associated 
; with a given key in an assoc list, returning #f in case of a look-up failure:
#| Standard implementation
(define (look-up key alist)
	(let ((found-assoc (assq key alist)))
		(and found-assoc (cdr found-assoc))
)	)
 |#;->	A more elegant solution
#|
(define (look-up key alist)
	(cdr (or (assq key alist) '(#f . #f)))
)
 |#; An implementation which is just as graceful as the latter
#|   and just as efficient as the former:
(define (look-up key alist)
	(and-let* ((found-assoc (assq key alist))) (cdr found-assoc))
)
 |#; AlSchemist replaced x with found-assoc to more easily compare the solutions

#| Generalized cond:
(or
	(and-let* (bindings-cond1) body1)
	(and-let* (bindings-cond2) body2)
	(begin else-clause)
)
 |#
; Unlike => (cond's send), AND-LET* applies beyond cond.
; AND-LET* can also be used to generalize cond,
; as => is limited to sending of a single value; 
; AND-LET* allows as many bindings as necessary (which are performed in sequence)
#|
(or
	(and-let* ((c (read-char)) ((not (eof-object? c))))
		(string-set! some-str i c) (inc! i)
	)
	(begin (do-process-eof))
)
 |#

; Another concept AND-LET* is reminiscent of is programming with guards:
; an AND-LET* form can be considered a sequence of _guarded_ expressions.
; In a regular program, forms may produce results, bind them to variables
; and let other forms use these results.
; AND-LET* differs in that it checks to make sure that every produced result 
; "makes sense" (that is, not an #f).
; The first "failure" triggers the guard and aborts the rest of the
; sequence (which presumably would not make any sense to execute anyway).
